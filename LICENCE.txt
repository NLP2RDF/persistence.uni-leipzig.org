The licences can be found in the individual ontologies.
Normally, we try to keep it to CC-BY at the maximum. Please name our Project NLP2RDF or OLiA, lemon, NERD, etc. 
Don't hesitate, however, to use it in in your research or commercial applications.
We can also lower the licence to Public Domain, if you think it is necessary. 
It would be nice to drop us a line, if you use any of the ontologies (e.g. the mailing list at http://nlp2rdf.org or hellmann_at_informatik.uni-leipzig.de).
