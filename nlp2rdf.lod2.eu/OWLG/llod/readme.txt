The Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud
-------------------------------------------------------

See http://linguistics.okfn.org/llod for documentation.

./llod.svg, ./llod.png, ./llod.pdf
	the most recent stable versions, i.e., the file(s) published under http://linguistics.okfn.org/llod

2011/01/
	first draft by Sebastian Hellmann and Christian Chiarcos, 
	deprecated (also contained non-open resources where no open 
	resources for a representative type of resource were not available)
2012/01/
	ppt version by Christian Chiarcos, Sebastian Hellmann and Sebastian Nordhoff
	afterwards, we switched to editing svg directly
2012/02/ 
	collaboratively developed svgs, whenever major revisions of the content of the
	stable/ directory occur, make sure to move the old versions to the corresponding
	directory
	
2012/09/
	As a result of the MLODE workshop (http://sabre2012.infai.org/mlode) , we now generate the cloud from http://thedatahub.org .
	The script to do so is not public yet, but will be soon. You can contact the Open Linguistic mailinglist, 
	if you think we should make an update.
