Sometimes, even an object resembling a spider can trigger a panic attack
in an arachnophobic individual. The above cartoon is a depiction of the
nursery rhyme "Little Miss Muffet", in which the title character is
"frightened away" by a spider.

Arachnophobia or arachnephobia (from the Greek: ἀράχνη, aráchnē,
"spider" and φόβος, phóbos, "fear") is a specific phobia, the fear of
spiders and other arachnids such as scorpions.[1]

The reactions of arachnophobics are often irrational (though not all
arachnophobics acknowledge this irrationality). It is one of the most
common specific phobias,[2][3] and some statistics show that 50% of
women and 10% of men show symptoms.[4] It may be an exaggerated form of
an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive,[5] or a
cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European
societies.[6]

The fear of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques
suggested for specific phobias. As with all phobias, the strength of the
associations means the individual must not actively pursue the
consequences, and outsiders should not in any way undermine and "play"
with the phobia in the meantime.

Symptoms and effect [edit]
--------------------------

People with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe
could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such
as webs. If arachnophobics see a spider, they may not enter the general
vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often
associated with their phobia. Some people scream, cry, have trouble
breathing, have excessive sweating or even heart trouble when they come
in contact with an area near spiders or their webs. In some extreme
cases, even a picture or a realistic drawing of a spider can also
trigger fear.

Arachnophobia can be triggered by the mere thought of a spider or even
by a picture of a spider in some cases. Some arachnophobics will, on
entering a room, search it for a spider. If they find one they will
monitor its progress very thoroughly. Others will do all in their power
to distract themselves to avoid seeing the spider.[7]

Evolutionary reason [edit]
--------------------------

An evolutionary reason for the phobias, such as arachnophobia,
claustrophobia, fear of snakes or mice, etc. remains unresolved. One
view, especially held in evolutionary psychology, is that the presence
of venomous spiders led to the evolution of a fear of spiders or made
acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there
is variability in the intensity of fears of spiders, and those with more
intense fears are classified as phobic. Spiders, for instance, being
relatively small, don’t fit the usual criterion for a threat in the
animal kingdom where size is a factor, but nearly all species are
venomous, and although rarely dangerous to humans, some species are
dangerous.

Arachnophobes will spare no effort to make sure that their whereabouts
are spider-free, hence they would have had a reduced risk of being
bitten in ancestral environments. Therefore, arachnophobes may possess a
slight advantage over non-arachnophobes in terms of survival. However,
this theory is undermined by the disproportional fear of spiders in
comparison to other, potentially dangerous creatures[8] that were
present during Homo sapiens environment of evolutionary adaptiveness.
Studies with crickets have shown that a fear of spiders can develop
before birth.[9]

Scientists suspect humans may be born with a fear of spiders and snakes,
which are healthy phobias that improve the odds of survival in the
wild.[citation needed] It's not known how such an inborn fear might
develop, however. Now researchers have proven that unborn crickets can
gain a fear of spiders based on their mother's harrowing
experiences.[citation needed] In humans, research also suggests the
widespread fear of spiders and snakes (arachnophobia and ophidiophobia,
respectively) may be innate. A study in 2008 found that both adults and
children could detect images of snakes or spiders among a variety of
non-threatening objects more quickly than they could pinpoint frogs,
flowers or caterpillars.[10]

Culture [edit]
--------------

In the Dark Ages spiders were commonly considered to be a source of
contamination of food and water.

The alternative view is that the dangers, such as from spiders, are
overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution. Instead, inheriting
phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival,
rather than being an aid. For some communities such as in Papua New
Guinea and South America (except Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Uruguay,
Argentina and Bolivia), spiders are included in traditional foods. This
suggests arachnophobia may be a cultural, rather than genetic trait. In
western societies as many as 55% of females and 18% of males are
estimated to experience arachnophobia.[11][12]

Treatment [edit]
----------------

Arachnophobia affects 3.5 to 6.1 percent of the population.[13] The
first line of treatment is systematic desensitization – also known as
exposure therapy – which was first described by South African
Psychiatrist Joseph Wolpe.[14] In addition beta blockers, serotonin
reuptake inhibitors and sedatives are used in the treatment of
phobias.[15]

Before engaging in systematic desensitization it is common to train the
individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques. Systematic
desensitization can be done in vivo (with live spiders) or by getting
the individual to imagine situations involving spiders, then modelling
interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually
interacting with real spiders. This technique can be effective in just
one session.[16] The discovery of the implication of
N-methyl-D-aspartate in fear and fear extintion has led to the use of
D-cycloserine—originally developed as an antibiotic—to augment the
results of therapy.

Recent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or
augmented reality spiders for use in therapy. These techniques have
proven to be effective.[17][18] There is an iOS app currently in
development using games and augmented reality to treat
arachnophobia.[19]
